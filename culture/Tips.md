# cultural suggestions
Most great engineers want to be on teams with other great engineers. So how do you geat this great engineers
in the first place?  
First of all, they will want to be able to not only contribute to the development of your product, but also
participate in the product's decision-making process.  
In the case of top-down management, the alpha engineer is the team lead and lesser engineers are hired as
team members. This is because subservient team members cost less and are easier to push around. And spoiler,
you are going to have hard times to find great engineers want to be in this team. Why would great engineer
want to ride a bus when she can drive the bus at another company? But in case of ```consesus-driven management```,
the entire team participates in the decision-making process.  
What we mean by ```consesus``` is that everyone has a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for the
product's success and the leaders really listen to the team(with the emphasis on the ```respect```).  


Easygoing cultures built on respect are more vulnerable to distruption by aggresive people than aggresive cultures are
vulnurable to disruption from more easygoing people. Team should be aware of this and not let the aggresive newcomer
take over, typically by refusing to engage this person in an aggresive tone. Senior team members may have to meet the
aggresive newcomer head-on to prevent her from harming an easygoing team culture.  


# communication patterns
A good general rule around communication is to include as few people as necessary in ```sync``` communication (like meethings),
and to go for a broader audience in ```async``` communication (like email).  
## to have a single mission statement
example: GWT's mission is to radically improve the web experience for users by enabling developers to use existing Java
tools to build on-compromise AJAX for any modern browser.  
## efficient meetings
standups should be short if not ommited at all.  
if you are trying to design something new, try to include no more than five people in your meeting.  
five simple rules for running a meeting:
* only invide a people who absolutely need to be there
* have an agenda and distribute it well before the meeting starts
* end the meeting early if you have accomplished the meeting's goal
* keep the meeting on track
* try to scedule the meeting near other interrupt points in your day (e.g., lunch, end of day)

Whoever's running the meeting should actually run the meeting and not hesitate to (gently) cut off someone who
veers off-topic or, even worse, tries to monopilize the conversation.  
## do design docs
having said that, make sure you don't take the 'design doc religion' to the opposite extreme. We have seen control
freaks write a four-page design essay for a program that's only 100 lines of code.

# leadership
industrial revolution, workers easy to replaces, managers from military hierarchy  
but ```anachronistic 'carrot and stick' method``` is not working anymore  
antipatterns:
* hire people you can push around (someone who are more insecure than you)
* ignore low performers
By ignoring low performer, you hurting him, because he probably could do some better impact in other place,
you also hurting your high performers because they have to look after low performer. So how to deal with it?
It almost always requires temporary micromanagement - but still lot of ```respect```. Set up a specific time frame
(say, two or three months), and some very specific goals you expect him to achieve in that period. Make the goal
small and incremental, so there's an opportunity for lots of small successes. Meet with the engineer every week to
check on the progress, and be sure you set really explicit expectations around each upcoming milestone. If the low
performer can not keep up, it will become quite obvious to both of you early in the process.
* ignore human issues
* be everyone's friend
* compromise the hiring bar
A people hire other A people; B people hire C people
* treat your team like children
patterns:
* lose the ego
have as self-confidence and cultivate a strong ```collective team ego and identnty```
* relax
master the ability to maintain calm at all times. No matter who blew up, no matter
what crazy thing happened,no matter how big the firestorm, never panic
* ask questions
the engineer asking for advice typically doesn't want you to solve his problem, but
rather to help ```him``` solve it, and the easiest way to do this is to ask him questions
* be a teacher and a mentor
give just enough information the person need, dont overexplain
* be honest
I won't lie to you, but I will tell you when I can't tell you something or if I just don't know
* track happiness

other tips:
* get your hands dirty asap
one of the easiest ways to gain the team's respect and get up to speed on what the're doing is to
get your hands dirty - usually by taking on a grungy task no one else wants to do; you can have
resume and list of achievements a mile long, but nothing lets a team know how skillful and dedicated
(and humble) you are like jumping in and actually doing some hard work

* seek to replace yourself
* sheild your team from entropy
* tolerate things that can be easy undone, and thing 10x times about hard decisions

motivation:
* autonomy
* mastery
* purpose
