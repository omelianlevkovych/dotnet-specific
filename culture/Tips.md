Most great engineers want to be on teams with other great engineers. So how do you geat this great engineers
in the first place?  
First of all, they will want to be able to not only contribute to the development of your product, but also
participate in the product's decision-making process.  
In the case of top-down management, the alpha engineer is the team lead and lesser engineers are hired as
team members. This is because subservient team members cost less and are easier to push around. And spoiler,
you are going to have hard times to find great engineers want to be in this team. Why would great engineer
want to ride a bus when she can drive the bus at another company? But in case of ```consesus-driven management```,
the entire team participates in the decision-making process.  
What we mean by ```consesus``` is that everyone has a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for the
product's success and the leaders really listen to the team(with the emphasis on the ```respect```).  


Easygoing cultures built on respect are more vulnerable to distruption by aggresive people than aggresive cultures are
vulnurable to disruption from more easygoing people. Team should be aware of this and not let the aggresive newcomer
take over, typically by refusing to engage this person in an aggresive tone. Senior team members may have to meet the
aggresive newcomer head-on to prevent her from harming an easygoing team culture.
