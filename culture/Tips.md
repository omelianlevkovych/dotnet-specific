# cultural suggestions
Most great engineers want to be on teams with other great engineers. So how do you geat this great engineers
in the first place?  
First of all, they will want to be able to not only contribute to the development of your product, but also
participate in the product's decision-making process.  
In the case of top-down management, the alpha engineer is the team lead and lesser engineers are hired as
team members. This is because subservient team members cost less and are easier to push around. And spoiler,
you are going to have hard times to find great engineers want to be in this team. Why would great engineer
want to ride a bus when she can drive the bus at another company? But in case of ```consesus-driven management```,
the entire team participates in the decision-making process.  
What we mean by ```consesus``` is that everyone has a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for the
product's success and the leaders really listen to the team(with the emphasis on the ```respect```).  


Easygoing cultures built on respect are more vulnerable to distruption by aggresive people than aggresive cultures are
vulnurable to disruption from more easygoing people. Team should be aware of this and not let the aggresive newcomer
take over, typically by refusing to engage this person in an aggresive tone. Senior team members may have to meet the
aggresive newcomer head-on to prevent her from harming an easygoing team culture.  


# communication patterns
A good general rule around communication is to include as few people as necessary in ```sync``` communication (like meethings),
and to go for a broader audience in ```async``` communication (like email).  
## to have a single mission statement
example: GWT's mission is to radically improve the web experience for users by enabling developers to use existing Java
tools to build on-compromise AJAX for any modern browser.  
## efficient meetings
standups should be short if not ommited at all.  
if you are trying to design something new, try to include no more than five people in your meeting.  
five simple rules for running a meeting:
* only invide a people who absolutely need to be there
* have an agenda and distribute it well before the meeting starts
* end the meeting early if you have accomplished the meeting's goal
* keep the meeting on track
* try to scedule the meeting near other interrupt points in your day (e.g., lunch, end of day)

Whoever's running the meeting should actually run the meeting and not hesitate to (gently) cut off someone who
veers off-topic or, even worse, tries to monopilize the conversation.  
## do design docs
having said that, make sure you don't take the 'design doc religion' to the opposite extreme. We have seen control
freaks write a four-page design essay for a program that's only 100 lines of code.

# leadership
industrial revolution, workers easy to replaces, managers from military hierarchy  
but ```anachronistic 'carrot and stick' method``` is not working anymore  
antipatterns:
* hire people you can push around (someone who are more insecure than you)
* ignore low performers
By ignoring low performer, you hurting him, because he probably could do some better impact in other place,
you also hurting your high performers because they have to look after low performer. So how to deal with it?
It almost always requires temporary micromanagement - but still lot of ```respect```. Set up a specific time frame
(say, two or three months), and some very specific goals you expect him to achieve in that period. Make the goal
small and incremental, so there's an opportunity for lots of small successes. Meet with the engineer every week to
check on the progress, and be sure you set really explicit expectations around each upcoming milestone. If the low
performer can not keep up, it will become quite obvious to both of you early in the process.
* ignore human issues
* be everyone's friend
* compromise the hiring bar
A people hire other A people; B people hire C people
* treat your team like children
patterns:
* lose the ego
have as self-confidence and cultivate a strong ```collective team ego and identnty```
* relax
master the ability to maintain calm at all times. No matter who blew up, no matter
what crazy thing happened,no matter how big the firestorm, never panic
* ask questions
the engineer asking for advice typically doesn't want you to solve his problem, but
rather to help ```him``` solve it, and the easiest way to do this is to ask him questions
* be a teacher and a mentor
give just enough information the person need, dont overexplain
* be honest
I won't lie to you, but I will tell you when I can't tell you something or if I just don't know
* track happiness

other tips:
* get your hands dirty asap
one of the easiest ways to gain the team's respect and get up to speed on what the're doing is to
get your hands dirty - usually by taking on a grungy task no one else wants to do; you can have
resume and list of achievements a mile long, but nothing lets a team know how skillful and dedicated
(and humble) you are like jumping in and actually doing some hard work

* seek to replace yourself
* sheild your team from entropy
* tolerate things that can be easy undone, and thing 10x times about hard decisions

motivation:
* autonomy
* mastery
* purpose

# the final goal of behavior interview
is to figure out whether you will make the work done, they are not looking for drinking buddy after all;


# avoid
## not respecting others time
other than spending a few minutes of their own time reading fundamental project documentation, mission
statements, FAQs, or the last email discussion treads, toxic people repeatedly distract the entire team with
questions things they could easy figure out on their own
## ego
## overentitlement
## paranoia
## perfectionism


# the art of organizational manipulation (politics, social engineering)
## your life under ideal manager
- ```pursue extra responsibility```. dont only cut trees; draw on map all trees to cut, come back and discuss
with senior treecutters how more optimal you all can cut the treees
- ```take risks and don't fear failure```. and if fail; fail fast
- ```act like an adult```
- ```question things that you are unsure about```
- ```your manager is not clairvoyant``` its hard to overcommunicate; update your team's leader on what
you're doing before she asks you what's going on
## your life under bad manager
some red flags of bad manager:
- fear of failure
- insecure manager will insist on inserting herself into any interaction you have with people outside
your team, and preventing you speaking directly to other teams

# bad organizations
acknowledge the way things are, and focus on navigating your organization's structure to find the
mechanisms you can use to get things done and to carve out a happy place for yourself in your company.  
Whether you are in a good organization or a bad one, there a number of strategies that we've found to be
quite effective at getting things done.
## it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission :)
while asking for permission does give you an opportunity to push responsibility onto someone else, it also
creates an opportunity for someone to tell you 'no'  
```choose your battles wisely``` - every time you have to plead your case for something or go up against someone
else in your company, you are spending your political capital. If you spend all your capital winning a bunch of
battles that just don't matter, you're going to find you have nothing left in your account when it comes to the
important things. Be strategic and fight for things that rather matter or that you're pretty sure you have some
chance of winning.
## if you cant take the path, make the path
if you can get enough people to buy into your idea or use a particular product, it will often be too late for the
bureaucracy to squash you, and management will be forced to notice (you and your idea) and either accept it or act
against it (which cost them political capital!)
## learn to manage upward
ensure that both your manager and the people outside your team are not only aware of what you are doing, but are aware
that you are doing it well. some engineers find this model of 'selling yourself'ugly, and it may remain so, but the benefits
of doing this are huge. basically, you need to ```underpromise and overdeliver whenever possible```  
try to avoid, whenever you can, promising things that you can't deliver, even if it means saying 'no' more often than you want to  
if you constantly miss deadlines and drop features, other people in the company will have less of a reason to trust you and will
most likely pass over you when the're looking for someone to get something done  
as an engineer, try to focus on ```launching products (features)``` over just about anything else  
```shipping things gives you credibility, reputation, and political capital more than just about anything else in the company```  
as tempting as it might be to spend a ton of time cleaning up your code base and refactoring things, we've learned from experience
that if you dedicate more that half of your time to this kind of defensive work, it's hardly valued at all and you'll find yourself in
the somewhat emberrassing position of having nothing (politically) important to show for your time  
```offensive work``` is typically effort toward new user-visible features, while ```defensive work``` is effort aimed at the long-term
health of the product (code refactoring, feature rewrites, data migration, improvement of emergency monitoring). Unfortunatelly, the truth
about life is that you dont get any political credit by doing defensive work.  
rule: ```no more than 1/3 of your time for defensive work``` - otherwise political suicide  
## luck and the favor economy
every job has this sort of gray-market economy; there's usually something you can quickly and easily do that benefits your company but
is someone's else job, and if you keep your eyes open for the chance to do these things, you will earn a bit of credit in this favour economy  
think of these credits like a small bets: someone will never pay you back, other will pay even more, and still other will pay enormous dividents  
## get promoted to a position of safety
in most companies, you need to put some amount of effort into 'playing the promotion game' to get yourself promoted (usually in addition to 
excelling at your job)  
putting an effort toward getting promoted when you're comfortable in your position is a great way to invest in your security and happiness when
something bad happens to your company or team (new aswhole manager, etc)  
```keep track of your accomplishments and use them in your selfassesments```  
## seek powerful friends
## plan B: Get Out
```do the right things, and wait to get fired```; if you dont get fired, you have done the Right Thing for everyone. If you do get fired,
this is the wrong employer to work for in the first place. So, either way, win-win.
